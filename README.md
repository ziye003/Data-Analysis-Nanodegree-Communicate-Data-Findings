# Data-Analysis-Nanodegree-Communicate-Data-Findings
### Project details
This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, I will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset. I will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part is structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships. 

In the second part, I will take the main findings from your exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, I will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate your results. This part of the project should make heavy use of the first part of the project. 

#### Step 1.1: Choose Dataset
The FordGoBike System Dataset is chosen for this data. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco
Bay area

#### Step 1.3: Explore Data
The report should briefly introduce the dataset, then systematically walk through the points of exploration. 

#### Step 2.1: Document Story
At the end of the exploration, I will summarize your main findings and reflect on the steps you took in data exploration. 

#### Step 2.2: Create your Slide Deck
Create a slide deck with explanatory data visualizations to tell a story about the data you explored. 

### Summary
The average time for a trip is 11.2 minutes while the longest trip took 1402 minutes. However, majority of trips took less than 10 minutes. The distribution of duration in minutes is a skewed distribution that has a longer tail in the right section. As for starting time of the trip, 8:00 and 17:00 are the time with the most trips. Thursday is the day with the highest number pf trips, followed by Tuesday. Weekends have the least number of trips. The multivariate exploration strengthened some findings about duration and daily usage in univariate and bivariant explorations, for example, the two time spans with high usage of bikes, which are 7:00-9:00 and 16:00 - 18:00. However, multivariant analysis also revealed that this is only valid from Monday to Friday. For week ends, the usage reduce significantly at those two time spans. Also, there is moderate but consistend bike usage from 10:00 to 15:00 everyday throughout the week, which was not found in previous analysis. There are many trips that is at the duration below 30 mins occured at the two peak hour of day, 7:00-9:00 and 16:00 - 18:00. Not many trips for any durations from 0:00 - 5:00. This tells us that the peak hours trips are mostly short trips, while longer trips, such as 2hr-5hr trips, occurs constantly throughtout the day regardless of time.
